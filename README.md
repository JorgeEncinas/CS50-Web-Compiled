# CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

<p align="justify">The course assigns several projects to work on and build your knowledge on Web Programming. This is my work.
I must warn you, I did not focus on the styling of the websites, which I realize is a big part in making a good impression. I apologize.
Looking back on it, now that I've learned how Bootstrap works, it was not that difficult a task. I'll dedicate time in the near future to it.

Another thing is that I should adapt later projects to use React on the front-end side. Either way, doing these projects was quite a journey for me.
I'm happy I persevered through it.

I'm still missing one more project: a free-form web system that is sufficiently distinct from the other assignments. On to the explanation of each: </p>

## Search

[Check it out](https://github.com/JorgeEncinas/cs50web-search)

<p align="justify">This first project is a recreation of Google's CSS design, and also querying their search tool, so that my website behaves
exactly as Google's does.
It has one slight quirk that I never ironed out completely: When you hover above the search bar, the borders on it disappear, being replaced by a slight shadow below
the bar. However, this change causes the bar to move upwards a bit. <br>
My theory is that it's because the bar's adjusting automatically to the flex.
As the size of it changes slightly without the borders, it moves a bit. I have to fix that little detail.

## Wiki

[Check it out](https://github.com/JorgeEncinas/cs50web-wiki)

<p align="justify">This is a wiki-like site, where you save entries to markdown files (.md extension). CS50 already provides ways to save and retrieve the entries,
I just had to create the requested functions in the Backend. </p>

## Commerce

[Check it out](https://github.com/JorgeEncinas/cs50web-commerce)

<p align="justify">An Auctions website, where users can create Auctions, and also Bid on them. This project starts you off on using Models.
 Said models can give you a pretty good idea on the functionality implemented:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listing</li>
  <li>Category</li>
  <li>Bid</li>
  <li>Comment</li>
</ul>

## Mail

[Check it out](https://github.com/JorgeEncinas/cs50web-mail)

<p align="justify">This project requires working only on the Frontend with pure JavaScript. It's, as the name suggests, a mail system.
 You can send, read, reply, and archive/unarchive mail, all without reloading the page, as it's all made using fetch calls.
  The Backend was already written; it was up to me to use it and display content accordingly.</p>

## Network

[Check it out](https://github.com/JorgeEncinas/cs50web-network)

<p align="justify">This is a Social Media website, very much like Twitter. I had to work on both Backend and Frontend on this one. 
This is the one that required the most work for sure. You can post, like/unlike posts, follow people, edit posts.</p>
